This project covers how to Fine-tune a BERT model for text classification using TensorFlow and TF-Hub. This is a transfer learning assignment, so the pre-trained BERT model can be found at "https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12/2".

Visit "http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/" to have an extensive understanding of Transformers network. BERT uses the transformers network for its NLP tasks. The pre-trained BERT network can be fine-tuned and adapted for various applications. In this assignment it is used for classifying the text in quora database.

The text is first pre-processed, tokenized then the BERT model is trained and evaluated on the desired data set.
